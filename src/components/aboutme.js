          I haven't always been into coding, in fact, I'm coming to this later
          in life at 32 years old(not that old!). But why now? In fact, if I
          continued on my current career path as a golf professional, we would
          be financially stable within the next 10 years. I've done really well
          with the golf industry in the last 4 years, and if I chose to, I could
          have a bright future in golf. Here's the thing: I haven't had to turn
          my brain on for the last 4 years. Yes, there are definitely challenges
          that come with this job, but I'm just not growing as an individual in
          any way that's valuable to me. I looked at my boss and asked myself,
          could you be happy doing what he's doing in 30 years? The thought made
          me sick to my stomach, actually. So, I started to explore options.

          My first thought was data analysis. With an economics degree and an
          affinity for mathematics, this seemed like a great option. I took a
          class on teamtreehouse.com on mySQL and powered through it in a week,
          soaking it up like a sponge. All the while I was racing through this
          course, I was exploring what my next step would be. Everywhere I
          looked, JavaScript dominated the stage. And, if you want to learn
          JavaScript, you should know HTML and CSS so you can make websites. All
          of a sudden, I was going down the path of web development instead of
          database analysis, and I don't even know how it happened, but I loved
          it. The first time I put some HTML tags on a page and hosted it up
          onto a local server, I lost my mind and haven't been right since. Now,
          I'm so deep into it, I can't figure out what I did before I started
          doing this.

        <h4>
          That brings me to what I did before I started learning web
          development. After I fumbled my first go-around at college, I
          regrouped for a year, and enrolled at Alamance Community College. Much
          like my current state of mind-lossedness, I went into beast-mode in my
          studies. I stayed on the President's List for the entire year and a
          half I was there, and graduated with a 3.9 GPA and an Associate's
          Degree in business administration. While I was there, I discovered
          that I loved economics while everyone else in the class was either
          failing or bashing their head against the wall in the corner. I
          decided that it would be advantageous to pursue this, since it was so
          difficult, at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I spent
          one semester on the Chancellor's List and finished the curriculum in 3
          short semesters. I loved the challenge provided by economics; it seems
          that if I can find something that's incredibly difficult, it
          invigorates me.

          I now have a young daughter, an enthusiastic golden retriever, and a
          very supportive fiance; things have panned out nicely in the personal
          aspect of my life. If I can make this leap into web development and
          start to be challenged professionally on a daily basis, I will feel
          fulfilled. Until then, I will be on the daily grind trying to level up
          my skills to get to the point of being hireable. If you think I could
          be of value, don't hesitate to contact me and rescue me from the golf
          industry! Cheers!
